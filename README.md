# Dynamics_of_tumor_immune_cells

Modelling the dynamics of tumor and immune cells via 3 sets of time-delayed differential equations. While time-delayed differential equations are notoriously difficult to solve, they can be approximated with difference equations which can be numerically solved/ simulated.

The work is based on the following [paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Mathematical-modeling-and-analysis-of-tumor-immune-Kartal/6c3928550e71cd67013e6f4d235b1db3bffc9f09).
